#Xcode Launch
By Kristian Freeman

##What?
Xcode Launch is a personal tool for launching different versions of Xcode. In my instance, I use the stock Xcode from the App Store for production (submitting app .ipas) and the beta from [ADC](http://developer.apple.com) for testing on my phone.

##How?
It's not super clear yet, but change the string locations in `AppDelegate.m` to match your Xcode locations.
